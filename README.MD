# RAG — Basics to Advanced 📚🧠

This repository is my **personal learning workspace** for understanding and building  
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems** — starting from **fundamental concepts** and progressing toward **advanced, production-style implementations**.

The goal of this repo is **learning by building**:
- breaking things
- rewriting code
- experimenting with architectures
- and documenting real understanding over time

---

## 🎯 What This Repository Is

This is **not a tutorial repo** and not a polished framework.

It is:
- a **learning log**
- a **hands-on playground**
- a place where I explore how RAG systems actually work under the hood

I use this repo to:
- study RAG fundamentals
- experiment with different components (embeddings, vector stores, LLMs)
- refactor and extend existing implementations
- build new interfaces (CLI, later API / services)

---

## 🧱 What You’ll Find Here

Over time, this repository will include:

- 📘 Notes on RAG concepts (from basics to advanced)
- 🧠 Architecture explorations
- 🧪 Experiments and prototypes
- 🧾 Working implementations
- 🔁 Refactors and iterations
- ⚠️ Mistakes, fixes, and learnings

One of the major implementations in this repo is a **CLI-based Local RAG System**, which lives deeper in the repository structure.

## 🖥️ CLI-Based Local RAG System (One Implementation)

At a deeper level in this repo, I am working on a **command-line interface (CLI)** version of a local RAG system that:

- runs fully on a local machine
- uses local LLMs
- indexes personal documents
- supports semantic + keyword search
- allows chatting with documents

This implementation represents a **practical milestone** in my RAG learning journey, not the final destination.

> 📌 The detailed CLI documentation is available in its own `README.md` inside the relevant subdirectory.

## 🧭 Learning Scope (Evolving)

Topics explored in this repo include (and will grow):

- What RAG is and why it exists
- Document ingestion & chunking strategies
- Embeddings and vector similarity search
- Hybrid retrieval (semantic + keyword)
- Prompt construction for RAG
- Local LLM inference
- CLI-based interfaces
- Performance trade-offs
- System design decisions

This list will expand as my understanding deepens.

## 🙏 Credits & Acknowledgments

This repository is **inspired by and partially based on** the following open-source project:

- **jamwithai / beginner-local-rag-system**  
  https://github.com/jamwithai/beginner-local-rag-system

I use the original project as a **learning reference and foundation**, and then:
- study the architecture
- refactor parts of the code
- extend functionality
- build a CLI-based interface
- and adapt it to better understand RAG internals

All credit for the original implementation and ideas goes to the original author.

## 🚧 Status

🚧 **Actively learning & evolving**

This repo will change as:
- my understanding improves
- implementations are rewritten
- better approaches replace earlier ones

---

## ✍️ Final Note

This repository exists to **learn deeply**, not to look perfect.

If something looks simple, unfinished, or rewritten multiple times —  
that’s intentional. That’s how learning sticks.

**Learning RAG systems, one iteration at a time.**
